#Newly Created account, only 1 repository as of right now
#A repository with a README.md attached
#When you open GitHub for desktop you logon, "Clone Repository", I had to go into MS VS because GitHub wouldnt let me add a commit because it didn't recognize a new change, there is a button that says Push changes and it applies your changes to the website.
